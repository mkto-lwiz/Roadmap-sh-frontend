Sure thing! Here's a shorter breakdown of the flex property and how it works:

What is Flexbox?

Flexbox is a layout system that allows flexible, responsive designs without using floats or positioning.

The flex Property:

The flex property is shorthand for:

flex-grow: How much an item should grow relative to others (default is 0).

flex-shrink: How much an item should shrink when space is tight (default is 1).

flex-basis: The initial size of the item before it grows or shrinks (default is auto).

Syntax:
flex: <flex-grow> <flex-shrink> <flex-basis>;
.item {
  flex: 1 1 200px; /* Grow, shrink, initial size 200px */
}
1 (grow): The item will take extra space.

1 (shrink): The item can shrink if needed.

200px (basis): It starts at 200px wide.

How It Works:

flex-grow: If there’s extra space, the item will grow to fill it.

flex-shrink: If the container shrinks, the item will shrink proportionally.

flex-basis: Sets the initial size of the item before any growing or shrinking.
